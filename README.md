# Dynamic-Programming-Comparisons
Compares the runtime of different implementations of Fibonacci and optimal matrix chain problems
This project was done for my CS 4120 Algorithms class.

## To compile, just download all the files and run a command like:
g++ main.cpp Fibonacci.cpp MatrixChain.cpp Testing.cpp

## To run, some command like:
./a.out
